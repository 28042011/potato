<h1>super nova</h1> 
 
<p style="color:purple;">A supernova is the colossal explosion of a star.
 Scientists have identified several types of supernova. 
One type, called a “core-collapse” supernova, occurs in the last stage in the life of massive stars that are at least eight times larger than our Sun. 
As these stars burn the fuel in their cores, they produce heat.
This heat produces pressure that pushes outward against the forces of gravity that pull inward on the star. 
For most of the life of a star, inward gravity and outward pressure are in balance and the star is stable.
 But as a star burns through its fuel and begins to cool, the outward forces of pressure drop.
 When the pressure drops low enough in a massive star, gravity suddenly takes over and the star collapses in just seconds. 
This collapse produces the explosion we call a supernova.</p>
