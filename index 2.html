<h1>black holes</h1>     

<p style="color:red;">Black holes are among the most mysterious cosmic objects, much studied but not fully understood. These objects aren’t really holes. 
They’re huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces.
 A black hole is so dense that gravity just beneath its surface, the event horizon, is strong enough that nothing – not even light – can escape.
 The event horizon isn’t a surface like Earth’s or even the Sun’s.
 It’s a boundary that contains all the matter that makes up the black hole. </p>
